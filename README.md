    Hello world! and welcome to my slice of cake, My chunk of web, to the world (which is mine) of 'PythonXadds' <head>

        <body>This blog is a place where I like to write my thoughts about anything, though that's far too liberal a subject matter
        for any blog/page. Readers like to know exactly what a bog is about, but since I very much doubt I will ever have such a person
        as a reader, I don't really need a subject. 

        Though; I am going to give a few, whilst we are on the subject. My main interests are: Linux, Open source, Python programming
        (as my name suggests) and all things computers. Perhaps a little poetry and prose, thrown into the mix, just
        to add a little interest, for myself. 
        
        And so it seems, I did write a list of subjects, and though not exaustive, I wouldn't want to bore myself to death!
